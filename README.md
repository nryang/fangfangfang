# fangfangfang

fangfangfang is a web application that allows you to defang and refang URLs in text.

Many applications convert URLs in documents to clickable links. These links could be malicious, and users may accidentally click on them. The goal of defanging is to prevent these URLs from being clickable but still human-readable. Refanging, on the other hand, involves taking a defanged piece of text and converting it back to the original text.

This application is a proof of concept. It is not intended nor suitable to be used in a production environment.
