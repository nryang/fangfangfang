# fangfangfang

fangfangfang is a web application that allows you to defang and refang URLs in text.

Many applications convert URLs in documents to clickable links. These links could be malicious, and users may accidentally click on them. The goal of defanging is to prevent these URLs from being clickable but still human-readable. Refanging, on the other hand, involves taking a defanged piece of text and converting it back to the original text.

fangfangfang supports multiple defanging and refanging translation models. Currently, the following models are supported:

| Model     | Example Input                                                                          | Example Defang                                                                       |

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Usage

Build the docker container:

```
docker-compose build
```

Start the docker container:

```
docker-compose up
```

Open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:56732/](http://localhost:56732/)

If everything is working, you should see the following page:

![UI](/images/ui.png)

fangfangfang also provides API endpoints for defanging or refanging text. You
can access the API documentation in your browser by navigating to:

[http://localhost:56732/ui](http://localhost:56732/ui)

If the API docs are working, you should see the following page:

![Generated API documentation](/images/api-docs.png)

To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` from your terminal.

## Known Issues

- In the generated documentation, examples like `hxxp:\/\/somewebsite[dot]com` are showing up as `hxxp:\\/\\/somewebsite[dot]com` where the backslash is repeated twice. This appears to be a bug in Swagger UI.

## Developer Notes

This project uses an API-first approach. The API spec is written in OpenAPI 3
and is defined in [openapi/openapi.yaml](openapi/openapi.yaml).

[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) takes the
OpenAPI spec and auto-generates the [controllers](fangfangfang/controllers),
[models](fangfangfang/models), and [basic integration tests](tests/test_api_controller.py).

To auto-generate the files (requires [Java 8+](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)):

```
cd bin
./codegen.sh
```

The auto-generated [controllers](fangfangfang/controllers) call the
implementation controller modules like [api_controller_impl.py](fangfangfang/controllers/impl/api_controller_impl.py).

[Connexion](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) uses the
[controllers](fangfangfang/controllers) to serve the REST
endpoints. It also serves static files like the
[Swagger UI documentation](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

To run all tests (requires [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)):

```
./test_python3.sh
```
